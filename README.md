# Youtube API Video Player

Currently learning Redux with this [course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) by Stephen Grinder. Used his [ReduxSimpleStarter](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter) to set up the app.

This is the first basic app built with this course.
Redux isn't used yet, just a review of React while using the Youtube API.

### Getting Started

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
